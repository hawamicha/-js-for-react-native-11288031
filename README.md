# Array and User Information Manipulation

This project consists of two main files: `arrayManipulation.js` and `userInfo.js`, which perform a series of data processing tasks.

## Task 1: Array Manipulation

In `arrayManipulation.js`, we define a function `processArray` that processes an array of numbers. It returns a new array where each even number is squared, and each odd number is tripled.

## Task 2: String Formatting

Still within `arrayManipulation.js`, we add a function `formatArrayStrings`. This function takes two arrays: one of strings and another of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on its corresponding numberâ€”capitalizing it if the number is even, and converting it to lowercase if the number is odd.

## Task 3: User Profile Creation

In `userInfo.js`, we implement a function `createUserProfiles`. It takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. The function returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and an auto-incremented `id` starting from 1.

## Usage

To use these functions, include the JavaScript files in your project and call the functions with the appropriate arguments as per your requirements.
